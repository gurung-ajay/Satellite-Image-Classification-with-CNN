# Satellite-Image-Classification-with-CNN
In this project, I built Convolutional Neural Network model to classify satellite images on four categories:
* Cloudy
* Desert
* Green area
* Water
After optimizations of the model by changing hyperparameters and model complexities, I was able to build a model that obtained validation accuracy of about 90%.

Tools used: Tensorflow, Matplotlib, OpenCV
